# SO FANCY!
With your pod, update the Baby Dragon to do at least two of the items from this list:

+ Add the ability to give the dragon water and have the dragon track it's thirst. Be sure to enforce consequences if time continues to pass and no water is given to the dragon.  
+ Add a color attribute for each baby dragon which will directly correlate to some sort of special behavior (your choice).  
+ Add another behavior of your choice:   
	+ crying or being upset  
	+ any other behavior you can think of!  
	+ ASCII text representation of any/all of the different behaviors (feeding, walking, etc.)  

## Presentation
At the end of this exercise you will be presenting to the class the new functionality you have added. Be prepared to include:  
+ A demo of new functionality  
+ Decisions your group made about updating the `passage_of_time` method  
+ Challenges your group faced and how you overcame them
